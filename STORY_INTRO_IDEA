So I think the story intro should be right before the game starts.
It should advance by having the player press space. Each time they press space a new line of the story comes up and maybe a small 
animation for the story.
Something along the lines of this:
"After 100 years the phoenix Phoejay is finally reborn." [Art of a pile of ashes starts to burn] (reuse revival transition art, floor art,
forest background art)
"The forest is familiar yet foreign to the young phoenix. Parts of the forest remain the same but it can tell that something has
changed..." [Fire stops burning to reveal Phoenix]
"The phoenix can feel something ominous in the air, but can't put its foot on what. And so it beings to explore..." [Phoenix walks off screen 
and then game starts]
